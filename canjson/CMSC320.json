It will be held in the same lecture hall where the class is normally held. The problems will be posted on Gradescope. You will submit a screenshot on the Gradescope Assignment (more details about the screenshot will be provided in the instructions on submission). This extra credit opportunity will let you earn full or partial credit depending on whether you can solve the problems in the given time. Expect four problems of various difficulties using Python and SQL (these cheatsheets are the documentation that will benefit you mostly while doing the problems). A practice quiz is provided to you with three different problems. You can submit as many times as you wish to test your speed and proficiency. You must attend in person to participate. There will be TAs in the lecture hall who can assist you. We will check timestamps on Gradescope if you submit too late. Feel free to attend online* for those with ADS Accommodations who wish to participate. There will be a Live Q&A Session on Piazza in which one of our TAs will monitor responses. *Edit for those with ADS Accommodations: Feel free to come and stay in the lecture hall for the entirety of the class time (3:30 PM - 4:45 PM) to get help in person and then move to a different location afterward to get help online till 5:30 PM.",
